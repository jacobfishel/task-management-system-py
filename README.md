#task management system using data structures in python

plan: 
have json files to read from and to write tasks into to save them

data structures:

    list for general storage of tasks
    dictionary for storing tasks with a title(might use this instead of list)

    heap to prioritize tasks

    graph to implement dependencies for tasks

    queue to manage tasks in a fifo order
